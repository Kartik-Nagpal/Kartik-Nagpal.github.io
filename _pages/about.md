I am a 4th Year Computational Engineering Major at the University of Texas at Austin and I do research in both Autonomous Systems and Orbital Mechanics Policy. I am in the [UT Autonomous Systems Group](https://u-t-autonomous.github.io/index.html) which operates under [Dr. Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu), and more specifically I do research alongside postgrad [Yue Yu](https://yueyu19.github.io/) on Real-Time Motion Planning Algorithms for UAVs, and Ph.D. Candidate [Steve Carr](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Steven%20Carr/) on Grid World Simulation Generation for Self-Driving Cars. Additionally, I am a member of the [ASTRIAGraph](http://astria.tacc.utexas.edu/AstriaGraph/) team which works to gather all relevant data on Anthropogenic Space Objects(ASOs) from a variety of sources and do data analysis and matching on a massive scale to form the largest Space Domain Awareness data framework in the world, which is mostly overseen by [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) Staff and [Dr. Moriba Jah](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/jah).
