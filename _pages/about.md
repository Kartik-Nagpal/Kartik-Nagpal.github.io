Howdy! I am a PhD Student in the Mechanical Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. I am  a member of the [ICON Lab](https://iconlab.negarmehr.com/), advised by [Dr. Negar Mehr](https://negarmehr.com/). My research focuses on learning intricate multi-robot behavior for safety-critical environments, with an emphasis on safe reinforcement learning and multiagent coordination. My latest publications are available on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UezOFIsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). In recognition of my recent work, I was awarded the NSF GRFP in 2024. 

Prior to beginning my graduate studies, I earned my B.S. in Computational Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. During my undergrad I had the priveledge of doing research with [Dr. Ufuk Topcu](https://u-t-autonomous.github.io/index.html) and [Dr. Moriba Jah](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/jah).
