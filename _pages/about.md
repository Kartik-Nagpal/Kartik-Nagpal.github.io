Howdy! I am a PhD Candidate in the Mechanical Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. I am part of the [ICON Lab](https://iconresearchlab.web.illinois.edu/) under [Dr. Negar Mehr](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/negar). I began my PhD at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and followed my advisor in transferring to UC Berkeley. My research is currently focussed on the application of Autonomous techniques to Aerospace Engineering, with a focus on applying Machine Learning and Game Theory to these problems. I am also particularily interested in inverse games and imitation learning.  
 
 During my undergrad, I was an assistant researcher in the [UT Autonomous Systems Group](https://u-t-autonomous.github.io/index.html) which operates under [Dr. Ufuk Topcu](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu), and more specifically I did research alongside postgrad [Yue Yu](https://yueyu19.github.io/) on Real-Time Motion Planning Algorithms for UAVs, and Ph.D. Candidate [Steve Carr](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Steven%20Carr/) on Grid World Simulation Generation for Self-Driving Cars. Additionally, I was a member of the [ASTRIAGraph](http://astria.tacc.utexas.edu/AstriaGraph/) team which works to gather all relevant data on Anthropogenic Space Objects(ASOs) from a variety of sources and do data analysis and matching on a massive scale, thus forming the largest Space Domain Awareness data framework in the world, which is mostly overseen by [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) Staff and [Dr. Moriba Jah](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/jah).
